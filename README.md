# CRM-HelpDesk-Solution
This project is a part of Enterprise Data Management Course.

It was developed for the client "Tech Launch Arizona". The purpose of this application is to provide a help desk solution where
the representatives/employees of different companies and students of the university can find each other to collaborate on 
various programs and events. Students raise tickets describing their interests and system managers find appropriate companies,
programs and events and share the results with students. In the same way, the system also facilitates employees to find students
they need to recruit or associate with.
